--- Fault Tolerance ---

Time Record:
			Reliability	Total Time
	mergesort	25% - 75%	15s - 17s
	quicksort	30% - 80%	13s - 15s
	heapsort	100.00%		32s - 35s
	recovery	100.00%		18s - 22s
	nversion	100.00%		20s - 25s

1. Recovery is better in this case. Because in the nversion version,
every case's time is the slowest case's time; but in recovery program,
there's always possibility that quick sort or merge sort does good job
and the total time is less than doing a merge sort.

2. In order to understand the time expectation, we can set p1, p2, p3
as mergesort's, quicksort's, and heapsort's reliability, and t1, t2,
t3 as their time cost. Then the expectation of recovery is
t1 * p1 + (t1+t2) * (1-p1) * p2 + (t1+t2+t3) * (1-p1) * (1-p2) * p3
and the expectation time of nversion is just t3 for each case.
